    <h3>Every dollar helps a student afford school lunch </h3>

    <p>
        Studies have shown that hunger impacts health and our ability to focus. Hunger can cause fatigue 
        and poor energy levels.

    <p>
        Hunger has negative effects on school-aged children. Instead of focusing in class, they focus 
        on what they can possibly eat.
